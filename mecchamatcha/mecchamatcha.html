            I visited Meccha Matcha and tried their unique option of choosing from three different levels of matcha, catering to a range of preferences. The first level, which is designed for beginners, was quite sweet and had a mild matcha flavor. To me, it tasted more like milk with a hint of matcha, which was a bit too light for my liking. However, my cousin, who was new to matcha, enjoyed the sweetness and smoothness of the drink at first. As he continued sipping, though, he started to notice the matcha flavor becoming stronger, and it seemed to catch him off guard. He liked it at first, but as the matcha flavor developed, he found it less enjoyable. Overall, itâ€™s a good option for those who are easing into matcha, but for someone who prefers a bolder taste, it might feel a bit too mild.
