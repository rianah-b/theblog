            <h3 class="headersinp">WHAT IS MECCHA MATCHA?</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Matcha is a matcha cafe located in Artesia, California. They spealize in Matcha Lattes and Matcha Soft Serve! Here you are able to choose from three different levels of matcha, catering to a range of preferences.
                </p>

                <h3 class="headersinp">TASTE</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">The first level, which is designed for beginners, was quite sweet and had a very mild matcha flavor. To me, it tasted more like milk which was a bit too light for my liking. However, my cousin, who was new to matcha, enjoyed the sweetness and smoothness of the drink.
                <h3 class="headersinp">FINAL THOUGHTS</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                Overall, it’s a good option for those who are easing into matcha, but for someone who prefers a bolder taste, it might feel a bit too mild.
