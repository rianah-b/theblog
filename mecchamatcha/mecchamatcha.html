                <span class="indent">Matcha is a matcha cafe located in Artesia, California.</span> They spealize in Matcha Lattes and Matcha Soft Serve! Here you are able to choose from three different levels of matcha, catering to a range of preferences.
                <br> <span class="indent"> The first level, which is designed for beginners, was </span>quite sweet and had a very mild matcha flavor. To me, it tasted more like milk which was a bit too light for my liking and didnt really seem worth the spend. However, my cousin, who was new to matcha, enjoyed the sweetness and smoothness of the drink at first. But throughout the day he continued sipping, and he started to notice the matcha flavor becoming stronger to which he didnt like. 
                <br>  <span class="indent">Overall, it’s a good option for those who are easing into </span> matcha, but for someone who prefers a bolder taste, it might feel a bit too mild.
