       <p>
        I recently tried the matcha at Insit Matcha in Buena Park, and unfortunately, it wasn’t my favorite. The flavor didn’t quite hit the mark for me—it tasted more like green tea ice cream than the rich, earthy matcha I was hoping for. While the texture was smooth, it felt overly sweet and lacked the depth of flavor that I typically enjoy in a good matcha. It almost had a dessert-like quality, which might appeal to some, but it wasn’t what I was looking for in a matcha drink. Overall, I didn’t find it to be as satisfying or authentic as I’d hoped, but it could be a good option for those who enjoy sweeter, ice cream-like matcha flavors.
