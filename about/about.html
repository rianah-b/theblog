        In this blog post, I’m sharing my experience trying matcha at three different spots in Orange County. Whether you’re a matcha enthusiast or new to matcha, I hope this helps you find a good place to try it. I also brought along my cousin, who had never tried matcha before (and barely drinks any drink besides water), to get his perspective as a first-timer. I visited three cafes that offer Iced Matcha Lattes. I’ll share my review of each place, discussing what I liked, what didn’t, and show my cousin’s honest feedback on his first matcha experience. Whether you’re a regular matcha drinker or just curious, this post will give you a sense of where to go and what to expect. If you’re in Orange County and looking for a matcha spot, this guide will offer some recommendations based on my experience, along with some insight from a complete beginner to help you decide if it’s worth a try.
