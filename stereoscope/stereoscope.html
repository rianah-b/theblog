            I recently tried the matcha at Stereoscope in Fullerton, and I was really impressed by the complexity of the flavor. Unlike other places, they offer different variants of matcha, which allows you to select specific notes that you prefer, making the experience more personalized. The matcha I had had a deeper, richer taste with a balance of earthy and slightly grassy notes, which I really enjoyed. However, my cousin, who’s new to matcha, found the flavors a bit too strange and didn’t fully understand the different layers. He mentioned that it felt a little too unusual for his taste, but I appreciated the uniqueness of the drink. Overall, Stereoscope offers a more refined matcha experience, but it might be a bit too complex for someone who’s just starting out with matcha.
